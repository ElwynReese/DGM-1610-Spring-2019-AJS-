-A class is an object.
-Public is an access modifier. It is an aspect of unityEngine that inherits from unityEngine.
-Class stands for Classification like in Mercades E-Class
-The colon : signifies that the class belongs to with something else.
public class Animal : MonoBehaviour 
the above line of code causes 'Animal' to inherit from 'MonoBehaviour'
-void means that there is nothing there. It is also a function type.
-Remote example, class of remote that has functions as buttons.
-Start starts when the game starts.
-Update updates once every time a frame is pushed.
-Curly brackets are containers for classes and functions.
-Every function requires open and closed parenthesis, they are called function declarations.
-The unity engine was built so that you don't have to make one from scratch. You are not a coder in this respect, you are a scripter.

-We went over classes and inheritance. This is the fundimental concept of working in an engine like unity. Without inheritance, the unity engine would be irrelavant.
